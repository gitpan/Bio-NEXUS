README_admin -- how to make NEXPL package and update web site
$Id: README_admin,v 1.3 2006/08/24 19:40:06 arlin Exp $


PACKAGE

1.  Make sure the package works before distributing it to the world.  See 
the note below about documentation.  

2.  Update cvs, tag the version, build makefile, make distribution

NOTE: if you don't tag the release, you won't get a new version number, and so 
you won't be able to upload to CPAN.   At least for now, we are tagging based 
on the percent completion of NEXUS commands, starting with 0.66 on 8/22/06.  

cd <cvs_copy_of_NEXPL>
cvs update
cvs tag release_xx_xx
cvs update
perl Makefile.PL
make dist

(Note: xx are integers. the tag should contain two integer values. The version 
numbers are obtained from the these numbers.
e.g.if tag name is release_0_66,then the version number is assigned 0.66 and the 
compressed file name will be NEXPL-0.66.tar.gz) 

3.  In the past, maybe for the near future, we are putting this on the web site: 

* copy new package and README file to web site (projects/nexus directory)
* edit projects/nexus/nexus-projects.shtml to reflect new package name 
(e.g., sed 's/NEXPL-[0-9.]*.tar.gz/NEXPL-alpha-45.tar.gz/g')


DOCUMENTATION

initially we are creating and editing the User Manual on the TWiki, but ultimately it 
will be converted to POD.  To convert the twiki to pod, just take the stuff 
from =pod to the end and do this: 

s/^---\+\+ /=head1 /
s/^---\+\+\+ /=head2 /
s/^---\+\+\+\+ /=head3 /

To get from TWiki to POD, do the reverse substitutions.
